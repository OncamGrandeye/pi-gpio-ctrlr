## Overview
The Input/Output/Motion Test Tool is used to generate motion and input on demand to external devices and monitor outputs from those same devices, which uses the Raspberry Pi platform. Itâ€™s purpose is to aid in the testing of devices by facilitating automated and manual tests. It does this by enabling you to generate input data to simulate the following devices:

* Digital input/Switches
* Visual motion when present within a camera's field of view.

And providing feedback for output pins, namely:

* Digital output/Relays

Two interfaces are provided for controlling input and reading output; HTTP and WebSockets. Additionally, a Web GUI (which uses the WebSockets interface and resides on the Raspberry Pi itself) is provided.

## Requirements

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or a Raspberry Pi Zero W
* SD Card suitable for loading Raspbian image
* Ethernet TP cable, for connecting the Arduino to a switch/router (for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)
* Mouse/Keyboard/HDMI Cable & Monitor (to initially setup the Raspberry Pi)
* Flat cable (or other cabling preference), for connecting the Arduino to the PACS device. How the actual physical cabling is performed is left for the user to decide. 
* USB cable, (Type?) for powering the Raspberry Pi.

### Software

* NodeJS
* pigpio
* To use the web GUI, a browser which supports both WebSockets RFC6455 and AngularJS is needed (Chrome version 30+ should work fine).
* There are dependencies to other Arduino libraries, see "Quick Start" for further details.
